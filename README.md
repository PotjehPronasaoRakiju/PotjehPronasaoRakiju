- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PotjehPronasaoRakiju
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming simple embedded systems (Arduino IDE, microPython) for microcontrolers with ESP32, ATMEGA and RP2040.
- I'm more into using hardware, so my codes are simple, I'm more focusing on work in Altium Designer and Matlab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying electronic and computer engineering in Zagreb. Also I was doing Erasmus exchange in UPV Valencia.
